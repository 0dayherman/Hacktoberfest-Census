# Hacktoberfest Census

### Thanks to all who participated this year, Happy #Hacktoberfest2017!

# Final Total:
### Pull Requests: 1803
### Accepted: 356 (lol :D)

### Another thanks to those who are helping accept the massive backlog of PR's (Although it probably still won't be cleared until #Hacktoberfest2018)!

A census of those participating in Hacktoberfest 2017 (and an easy PR!)

This census has a live webpage [here](https://cutwell.github.io/Hacktoberfest-Census), it's automatically updated every time a PR is accepted!
